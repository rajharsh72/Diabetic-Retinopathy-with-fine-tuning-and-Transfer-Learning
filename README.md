# 1.	What is Transfer Learning ?
    •	Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.
    •	It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing 
        tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in skill that they 
        provide on related problems.
    •	We first train a model on a given dataset (I’ve used ImageNet dataset) and then we use those generated weights into our task that was generated by 
        the pre-trained model.
    •	This optimizes our work and saves our time. 

    •	Some famous Transfer Learning models are: 

            i.	VGG Family 
            ii.	MobileNet
            iii.	ResNet50
            iv.	DenseNet
            v.	AlexNet
            vi.	Exception


# 2.	Things done in this repository. 
    •	I’ve used the pre-trained models i.e. VGG-19 , MobileNet v2 , ResNet50 , VGG-16 on the dataset containing the Iris Images having various abnormalities 
        like Glucomatic or having Achrima. 
        I've added some more CNN layers i.e. Inception layer and Global Average Pooling
    •	I’ve compared the accuracy , loss and Mean Absolute Error of all the different models.
